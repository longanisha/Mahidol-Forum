# npm resolution error report

While resolving: mahidol-forum@0.0.0
Found: react@19.2.0
node_modules/react
  react@"^19.1.1" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"^16 || ^17 || ^18" from react-quill@2.0.0
node_modules/react-quill
  react-quill@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
